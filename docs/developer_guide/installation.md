The development environment is managed with [package-tools](http://manuel.schmuck.doc.axelera.ai/package-tools). It can be installed with make:

```bash
make install.package-tools
```

In the background, this will install `package-tools` via `pipx` and make it available to you as a command line tool. Afterwards, you can run it with:

```bash
package-tools --help
```

For more information on how to use `package-tools`, please refer to the [documentation](http://manuel.schmuck.doc.axelera.ai/package-tools).
